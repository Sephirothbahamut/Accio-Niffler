The player is free to move around  the map in both human form that cat form. If Delphini is also in the player's party, she will follow the player in his every move, but if he is in cat form and enters a place not accessible to humans, Delphini will remain waiting for him When the player is faced with a obstacle, mysterious object or secret passage, he can: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the spells that he has learning to solve the puzzle.
    \item Has the possibility of being able to use the transfiguration to transform small objects into somethings that is needed at the moment.

\subsection{Combat mode}

Il sistema di combattimento è a turni con un solo cobattente autorizzato a compiere un'azione alla volta. All'inizio del combattimento personaggi e mostri vengono aggiunti alla scena e poi in base alle proprie statistiche viene scelto l'ordine di attacco. Quando nel party è presente anche Delphini il player può decidere solo l'azione di questo NPC, ovvero se attaccare oppure farle usare uno strumento. Quando il player decide l'azione di attacco per Delphini possono esserci due casi:

- Se il livello di amicizia è basso, l'attacco di Delphini è randomico.
- Se il livello di amicizia è alto, Delphini userà una spell per l'attacco combinato.

Il combattimento inoltre è in stile D\&D, ma le regole sono state leggermente modificate per rendere il gioco fluibile e divertente.
