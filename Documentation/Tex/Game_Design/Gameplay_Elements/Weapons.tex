In Hogwarts, everything is based on wizardry and spells: for this reason the wand, together with protective jewelry, will play an important role in combat, enhancing the magical capabilities of our characters in different ways.

\paragraph{Wands} 

The wand is the most important tool in a wizard's life: inner magical power is channeled through it and it can cast any kind of spell. Each wand is made of wood and contains an enchanted core, a special material usually coming from magical creatures.

There are several types of wand wood and cores, which will alter and enhance the capabilities of the wielder.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Holly} 
Holly will boost **defensive** spells, naturally meant for casters who think that a good defense is the best offense.

\end{itemize}

The wood will grant a bonus to its particular category of spells: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The bonus for non-Utility category will make spells of that category cast as 1 level higher (if applicable).
    \item The bonus for Utility category will grant an extra spell slot reserved to Utility spells for each spell level the character has access to.
\end{itemize}
