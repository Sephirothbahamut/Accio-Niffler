\paragraph{Exploration Mode}

The player is free to move around  the map in both human form that cat form. If Delphini is also in the player's party, she will follow the player in his every move, but if he is in cat form and enters a place not accessible to humans, Delphini will remain waiting for him When the player is faced with a obstacle, mysterious object or secret passage, he can: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the spells that he has learning to solve the puzzle.
    \item Has the possibility of being able to use the transfiguration to transform small objects into somethings that is needed at the moment.
    \item Transform into cat form and reach places inaccessible to human.
\end{itemize}

The player can interact with NPCs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In human form he can talk to them, they can make funny story or riddles.
    \item In cat form he can be stroked.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Combat System}
The combat is turn based. It mostly follows D\&D rules, only exception being that space and movement don't play any role: the combat happens like an old school sideview turn-based rpg. All the D\&D rules that involve moving around don't play any role. Area spells and skills will hit multiple enemies without checking an on-map position. Finally maximum range values for ranged spells and attacks will not play any role.

The main reason is increasing the pace of the fight, since a more complex system which involves movement, getting closer to the turn-based strategy games paradigm, would be too slow paced and complex for the ideal target audience.

\paragraph{Experience Points and Friendship Points}

Characters gain Experience Points by completing challenges, missions and minigames (lessons). When Experience Points reach a certain treshold, the Character's level rises. 
Each level grants all the spells of that level which have already been seen during a lesson.

Delphini has an stat in Frienship Points. These increase and decrease depending on the player's choices and successes in missions involving Delphini.

When Delphini is in the party and the friendship level is low, Delphini has access to more aggressive spells, up to Forbidden Curses. 
In contrast, if the friendship level is high, when Minerva attacks Delphini will use a reaction action to perform an attack toghether with Minerva.


\paragraph{Gryffindor Points}

When the player completes a task really well (perfect score in minigames, extremely good timing in timed tasks etcc) or when he fails terribly, some points are added to or removed from the player's House Points. Sometimes player choices can affect the points of other houses as well.
Grants an achievement on the chosen game platform if Gryffindor has the highest points by the end of the game.

\paragraph{Checkpoints}

Checkpoints are save points where the player can go back after a defeat. They appear as a Niffler statue which activates when the player makes an offer with a special coine called "Niffler Galleon".

\paragraph{Saving}

Checkpoints also save the game. The player can still save at anytime through the main menu. During battles saving is disabled.
