\subsection{Level World}

\paragraph{Forbidden Forest}
The level is set in two different areas of the world: firstly, Minerva and Delphini go into the Forbidden Forest to complete the Animagus ritual together. 

The place is a thick forest, gloom in the day and even darker in the night. It could seem a quiet and calm place, but it hosts many dangerous creatures and inhabitants, as well as uncovered and, perhaps, wondrous secrets.

The creaky and crumpled trees, with their convoluted and gnarly branches, give an eerie feeling when paired with the buzz and creaks of various insects that dwell inside of them.

It is no mystery why this area was prohibited to normal students: yet, some of them still wander inside of it for sheer curiosity or in search for unturned, concealed secrets.

\paragraph{Hogwarts' backdoor}

After that, they need to return to Hogwarts because the night is falling, especially they will sneak into the castle's backdoor and try to reach their own House dormitory.

In the darkness of the night, the two protagonists will try to slip through the corridors of the medieval castle, trying to evade the prefects and the caretaker patrolling them.

The stakes are high and getting caught, especially by the caretaker, is not an option.
