\subsection{Level World}

\paragraph{Forbidden Forest}
The level is set in two different areas of the world: firstly, Minerva and Delphini go into the Forbidden Forest to complete the Animagus ritual together. 

The place is a thick forest, gloom in the day and even darker in the night. It could seem a quiet and calm place, but it hosts many dangerous creatures and inhabitants, as well as uncovered and, perhaps, wondrous secrets.

The creaky and crumpled trees, with their convoluted and gnarly branches, give an eerie feeling when paired with the buzz and creaks of various insects that dwell inside of them.

It is no mystery why this area was prohibited to normal students: yet, some of them still wander inside of it for sheer curiosity or in search for unturned, concealed secrets.

\paragraph{Hogwarts' backdoor}

After that, they need to return to Hogwarts because the night is falling, especially they will sneak into the castle's backdoor and try to reach their own House dormitory.

In the darkness of the night, the two protagonists will try to slip through the corridors of the medieval castle, trying to evade the prefects and the caretaker patrolling them.

The stakes are high and getting caught, especially by the caretaker, is not an option.

\paragraph{Color Palette and lighting}
The gloomy Forbidden Forest is always permeated by a thick mist: the dark sky, combined with the moonlit fog, makes for the characteristic bluish haze.

The exteriors of Hogwarts appear as the classical moonlit castle, with a slightly blue light permeating stone, plants and wizards alike.

The interiors, instead, are characterized by much warmer colors: the sturdiness of the stone, the light of the candles, the tepid coming from the fireplace, all give a mild sense of safety.

\paragraph{Sounds and ambience}

The Forbidden Forest is a natural and wild place and as such it would be common to hear:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Creaking of trees
	\item Breeze of the wind
	\item Buzzing and crepitation of insects
	\item Squirming of acromantulas
	\item Clopping of centaurs 
	\item Chirping, cawing and hooting of birds
	\item Howling of wolves and cerberuses
\end{itemize}
A background music track for this section of the level could be around 55-60 bpm, based on soft strings and winds, to highlight the eerie calm in such a dark place.
A music track for the boss fight could be around 90-100 bpm, built upon the recurring notes of the gregorian Dies Irae, with which some players will be already familiar from other titles and movies.

Hogwarts' castle instead is a populated place and in the night possible sounds would be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Footsteps of the guards (prefects and caretaker)
	\item Chattering of people
	\item Crackling of the fire
	\item Whiffs of wind through the castle crevices
\end{itemize}
A background music track for this section of the level could be around 70-75 bpm (adagietto) to enhance the stealth feeling of sneaking through the castle, with quick and sudden recurring pizzicato.
