\section{Backup}
The backup is managed through the Git Hub repository. Each team member has an always up-to-date local copy of the repo on their computer, with all the previous revisions offered by the version control software Git.

It's sufficient to roll back to a previous release if anything fails, plus a parallel copy of the repo on each member's pc (3 + 1 hosted on GitHub) makes the project data extremely resilient to faults of any kind.
