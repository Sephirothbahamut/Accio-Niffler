Path Minerva has to follow for the first introductory part, trying to get the key to open the entrance door for Delphini.

Optimal solution for the second part of the level.

\paragraph{Note} Taking alternative paths in the two parallel corridoirs leads to the same result.

\paragraph{Part 1} Deliver Delphini to Slytherin's Dormitory.


\begin{enumerate}
\item Call Delphini from the corner only when the Caretaker looping around the courtyard isn't in sight.
	\item Make Delphini stop before the FOV of the Prefect.
	\item Take the secret passage in Cat-Form to emerge past the Prefect on the parallel corridoir, then loop around to the corridoir where Delphini is waiting.
	\item In Cat-Form Call Delphini so she starts moving towards Minerva, and immediately approach the Prefect to distract him, so Delphini will get past him.
	\item As soon as the top Caretaker starts moving, stay behind him and enter the bottom door halfway through the corridoir, with Delphini following you all the time. If you start moving too late the "other" caretaker coming from below will spot you.
	\item Wait for the Caretaker to reach the very right side to then move downwards, then go right-up and hide behind a column.
	\item Wait for the Caretaker to come back from below and turn left, then go bottom-right.
	\item Delphini succesfully reached Slitherin's Dormitory entrance.
	\item Backtrack to starting position.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Part 2}: Reach Gryffindor's Dormitory. Either happens after having helped Delphini, or at the start if Minerva refuses to help her.

\begin{enumerate}[label={\arabic*.}, resume]
	\item Reach the left side of the courtyard avoiding the FOV of the looping caretaker
	\item Like in step 3, wait for the Prefect to look the other way, and enter the secret passage in Cat-Form.
	\item Minerva succesfully reached Gryffindor's Dormitory entrance.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Bonus} (Before or after part 1): get the secret ingredient.

\begin{enumerate}[label={\arabic*.}]
	\item As soon as the Prefect looks the other wai reach the empty space on the other side of the middle column. Moving along the edges Minerva risks being caught by the patroling Caretaker, the safest solution is moving as fast as possible but looping widely getting closer to the Prefect before turning up.
	\item Keeping an eye on the caretake on the upper corridoir, move up from the left side as soon as he starts moving towards the right side.
\end{enumerate}
