\paragraph{Teaching mechanics in the level}
At the start of the level, the player witnesses his character completing the Animagus Ritual and her new ability to transform into a cat at will: after a short dialogue with Delphini, the latter proposes the player to test the new form in various
ways, especially her newfound ability to move through small passages and crevices and explore previously unreachable areas. \\

We follow the covert tuition method to teach the player how to use this ability: the player is encouraged to enter a small hollow log and reach a side area in which he can use cat form to climb easily some rocks that lead to a cliff. At the end of the cliff, the player can find an abandoned pouch containing some galleons and a few useful ingredients.

After returning to Delphini, the player can explore a bit more and can find that the big tree in front of them has a small hole, enough for a cat to fit through: if the player notices it, he can use his newfound ability to reach a hidden cave through the hole in the tree and find a valuable Onyx amulet and a generous amount of galleons, probably a treasure left by another animagus or some sneaky and greedy creature.\\

The Cerberus is a tough fight however, in earlier lessons, it was explained that they were vulnerable to the Sleep spell: in any case, Delphini reminds the player of it at the start of the fight in order to make it easier to get through it. \\

The second part of the level is thoroughly explained through dialogue by Delphini, however, the player can get comfortable at sneaking around in a relatively safe environment before completing his first objective, which is retrieving the key from the caretaker. After that, the level starts getting serious, and getting caught as a human by a caretaker is not an option. The game is more lenient in the case you're caught by him in cat form, giving you a second chance.
