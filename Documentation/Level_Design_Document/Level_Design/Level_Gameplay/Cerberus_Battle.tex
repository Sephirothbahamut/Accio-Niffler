\subsubsection{Cerberus Battle \& Statistics}

After the first turn, Delphini will remind Minerva (and the Player) that Cerberuses are vulnerable to sleep. If the player succeeds in casting Somnus (sleeping spell) the fight will cease and the two can escape (getting full rewards) without killing the Cerberus.

\paragraph{Reward} The player will get: 2300XP, 60 Galleon, 80 Sickle and 100 Knut.
