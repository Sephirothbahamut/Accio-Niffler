\textbf{Wands} In Hogwarts, everything is based on wizardry and spells: for this reason the wand, together with protective jewelry, will play an important role in combat, enhancing the magical capabilities of our characters in different ways.

The wand is the most important tool in a wizard's life: inner magical power is channeled through it and it can cast any kind of spell. Each wand is made of wood and contains an enchanted core, a special material usually coming from magical creatures.
